The goal of this analysis is to predict certain anomalities in the bitcoin price. For some context here an explanation of the German term **"Hausfrauenhoch"**  from ChatGPT:


> The German term **"Hausfrauenhoch"** refers to a phenomenon in the stock market where even inexperienced investors (often retail or small-scale private investors) start investing during a market phase characterized by significant price increases. This behavior typically occurs in the later stages of a bull market, just before a market correction or crash. The term alludes to the idea that even less knowledgeable investors (such as housewives, according to the clichÃ©) begin to invest in the stock market because they believe that profits are "guaranteed."
> 
> There isn't a direct equivalent term in English, but there are similar terms and phrases that can describe the concept. Examples include:
> 
> 1. **Late-stage bull market rally**  
>    Refers to the late phase of a bull market, where prices often continue to rise without fundamental justification, driven by optimism and speculation.
> 
> 2. **Retail investor frenzy**  
>    Describes the behavior of retail investors entering the market in large numbers, often without deep knowledge or expertise.
> 
> 3. **Market euphoria** or **irrational exuberance**  
>    These terms describe the over-the-top enthusiasm and often irrational overvaluation of markets.
> 
> 4. **FOMO buying** (Fear of Missing Out)  
>    Refers to the phenomenon where investors buy into the market out of fear of missing the rally, which further drives prices higher.
> 
> While none of these terms captures the exact nuance of *"Hausfrauenhoch,"* they can be used to describe the broader phenomenon in English.
